# TPP-Seiko-Watch-Fork
MGSV:TPP Countdown, based on [michaellfoo's codepen](http://codepen.io/michaellfoo/pen/mJOLMw) which is based on [murtnowski's codepen](http://codepen.io/Murtnowski/pen/PwBWmm)  
All I did was change the time variables so that it worked worldwide, and made the files locally hosted to fix the weird phantom cigar and to avoid leeching bandwidth
